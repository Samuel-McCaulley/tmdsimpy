    Saves VPRNM Amplitude and Phase Control key statistics to a text file for 
    easy monitoring.

    This function is intended for monitoring active runs. For final solution
    details, save the full solution and plot based on those results, not based
    on the results written out by this summary file.
    Function only intended to work for basic VPRNM, see module for other
    options.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    XlamP : (N+1,) numpy.ndarray
        Solution at the current step in physical coordinates (including 
        continuation parameter) to a VPRNM amplitude control set of equations.
        First entries are harmonic displacements,
        `XlamP[-4]` is cosine force scaling, `XlamP[-3]` is sine force scaling, 
        `XlamP[-2]` is frequency (rad/s), `XlamP[-1]` is amplitude level.
    dirP_prev : (N+1,) numpy.ndarray
        Direction for prediction from previous step to this step. 
        Can be used to get slope of solution at previous point w.r.t. `lam` 
        by dividing `dirP / dirP[-1]`
    fname : str
        Filename to save variables to. The output is a text file. 
        Recommended file extension is '.dat'.
    h : numpy.ndarray, sorted
        List of harmonics included in VPRNM solution.
    control_order : int, zero or positive
        Order of the derivative that is controlled. order=0 means 
        displacement output, order=2 means acceleration output
        Solely determines the header for the column, but does not
        effect any of the values since VPRNM directly controls the derivative
        order of the amplitude.
    output_order : int, zero or positive
        Order of the derivative that is output. `order=0` means 
        displacement output, `order=2` means acceleration output.
    output_recov_harmonic_list : list of tuples
        Each tuple contains 1. a `(Ndof,) numpy.ndarray` describing the output
        DOF and 2. an int describing which harmonic should be output.
        Behavior is undefined if output harmonic is not included in `h`.

    Returns
    -------
    None.
    
    Notes
    -----
    
    `Ndof` is the number of DOFs of the system while `N` is the number of 
    unknowns for the VPRNM residual at a given `lam` value.

    The output includes (for the current solution) force magnitude, frequency, 
    and the amplitude at the DOFs and harmonics defined by 
    `output_recov_harmonic_list` at displacement derivative `order`.
    Other functions in this module correspond to other variants of VPRNM/HBM.

    See Also
    --------
    tmdsimpy.Continuation : 
        Class for continuation where this function is intended to be used 
        as a callback function.
    tmdsimpy.VibrationSystem.vprnm_amp_phase_res : 
        VPRNM residual function. 
        This assumes that `XlamP` matches the unknowns vector for this residual
        function.
    combine_callback_funs : 
        Function for combining multiple callback functions for `Continuation`.
    continuation_save : 
        Function for saving the full solution points.
