Mech 566 Final Project Scripts:

Mech566Deterministic.py
Mech566Stochastic.py

The following packages are necessary to run the scripts:

numpy
pymc
arviz
matplotlib
Pytensor
pygad

I recommend installing pymc first, for which pymc will install the correct versions of numpy, arviz, and pytensor. Then install matplotlib and pygad separately. 

Please email me at sm327@rice.edu if there are any issues with the code. Thank you very much for your flexibility in the assignment.
